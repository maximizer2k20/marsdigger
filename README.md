# Mars Digger
Sample code for how a Robot taken to Mars would dig a hole in the Mars ground. 

This is a Python-based simulation of a Mars digging robot. The code assumes the robot has an arm with a digging tool and can communicate with a control system to monitor progress. 

It follows a step-by-step approach:

1.Move to the dig site

2.Activate the digging mechanism

3.Scoop the soil and deposit it nearby

4.Repeat until the required depth is reached
